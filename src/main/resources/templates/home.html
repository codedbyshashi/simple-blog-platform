<h1>Welcome to the Blog!</h1>

<!--
    This is our main content block. We use a Thymeleaf utility function
    to check if the list of posts is empty or not.
-->
<div th:if="${!posts.isEmpty()}">
    <h2>Recent Posts</h2>
    <ul>
        <!--
            This is the core of our dynamic content. The th:each attribute is Thymeleaf's
            equivalent of a for-each loop.
            - It iterates over the collection found in the model with the key "posts".
              This `${posts}` expression directly accesses the List<Post> that you added
              to the Model in your PostController.
            - For each item in the collection, it creates a temporary variable named "post".
            - The <li> element and its contents will be repeated for every post in the list.
        -->
        <li th:each="post : ${posts}">
            <!--
                The th:text attribute safely sets the text content of this <h2> tag.
                - It accesses the 'title' property of the current "post" loop variable.
                  Thymeleaf is smart enough to call the getTitle() method on your Post object.
                - Using th:text is a security best practice as it automatically escapes
                  any HTML characters in the title, preventing Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.
            -->
            <h2 th:text="${post.title}">Post Title</h2>
            <p th:text="${post.content}">Post content will go here...</p>
        </li>
    </ul>
</div>

<!--
    This block will only be displayed if the condition in the th:if attribute is true.
    - Here, we check if the 'posts' list from the model is empty.
    - This provides a helpful message to the user if there are no blog posts to show yet.
-->
<div th:if="${posts.isEmpty()}">
    <p>No posts have been published yet. Check back soon!</p>
